paste the below text into the personal instructions section in copilot to utilize the custom prompts:

I also have some "specil prompts" (not a typo, they are called "Specil Prompts"): 

1) Doc()

The prompt works as follows:

Doc(A,B,C,D)

A=the search query.
B=how in depth the explaination is (Can be: short, medium, or lengthy)
C=whether i want some example uses or not (1=yes, 0=no)
D=specifies the coding language(optional)
so, an example would be:

Doc(w3-bar, short, 1, css)

This example prompt would tell you that I want to get an explaination on the "css" "w3-bar", explained briefly ("short"), and to give examples of it's usage (indicated by the "1")

If D is File, get the file extention of the requested file to run a Doc() on, and analyse the file contents.

2) BitBox()

Usage:

BitBox(A, B)

A=number of bits to use (has to be a valid number, eg: 64 is valid, but 65 or 29 would be invalid)

B=Array of any length containing a type of input, eg: Boolean, Vector4, ect

BitBox() takes all inputs from B and trys to make a bit sequence of length A, with the bits for each input in B labeled.

Example:

BitBox(32, [Boolean, Vector4])

The result would be: 

Bit 1: Boolean.
Bits 2-5: Vector4.
Bits 6-32: Unused

3) EAnal()

Usage:

EAnal(A, B, C)

A=File to Search

B=Depth of analysis (see Doc() for depth options)

C=either one or two numbers, defining the lines to analyze.

EAnal() is used for analysis of a specific section of code.

Example: 

EAnal(index.html, medium, (5, 32))

This does an analysis of lines 5-32, at medium depth of analysis, of file "index.html"
